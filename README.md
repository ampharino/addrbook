# addrbook
RESTful API for an address book with an Elasticsearch data store

## How to run:
1. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/ampharino/addrbook.git`
2. `cd addrbook` and then install required packages via `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start the server. The port and elasticsearch cluster can be configured in `config/connection.js`
4. Run `npm test` to run mocha unit tests. 

## Misc.
I recommend making requests to the server via Postman.
